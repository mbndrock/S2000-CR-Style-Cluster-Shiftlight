## Open-source Shiftlight

# A project to add a shift indicator into my 2008 Honda S2000 gauge cluster where the green indicator would be on a CR S2000. 

2008+ clusters already have the space where the LED would be if it was soldered onto the PCB. I added a green LED Diode and removed the paint that blocks this hole on the lens with some alcohol. Eventually I would like to replace the LED with an RGB one and update the code to maybe light up solid red when the RPMs approach 7800-8000. 

Currently it is programmed as:
- 6000 RPM, start flashing at a 500ms rate
- Ramp up at a linear rate to 100ms once RPMs approach 7800
- Stay lit at >= 7800 RPM

Wiring was very simple:
- 12V to VIN
- Chassis to GND
- LED to D13
- Tachometer pulse signal to D2 (with a voltage divider in between)

Voltage divider was very simple to make with two resistors:

12V Pulsing Signal ---- R1 (4.7kΩ) ---- Arduino Pin (e.g., D2)
                           |
                          R2 (2.2kΩ)
                           |
                          GND
